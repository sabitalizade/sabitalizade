         <p>   I actually understood that if I studied Economics and mastered it, it wasn't for
  me, and I decided that the area that interests me was software, and after many
  language learning anchors, I decided to become a frontend developer. The truth 
   was that I was born on February 1, 1996 in a village and lived there for a long 
   time (about 20 years). Then, in 2013, I studied at the Department of Economics at
   Naxçıvan State University. I decided to study mastr after seeing that this
  University does not provide any benefit. While I was studying the master, 
   I wanted to do a job because I was very cheesy with the work that I will
   do with my stories. I wanted to move in this direction because I was very
   interested in technology and I researched whether software development
   would be without university education. When I heard the words 
  "can you be but work hard" in a video, I said, and I decided to learn throughout the master.
   So I will know the languages, but I was sure what I wanted to program. I started learning 
   C ++, C, but I didn't like it. I always wanted to have something visual, something would 
   come out when I wrote a code. After my researches, after a software developer living in
    America said that he was a frontend software developer and informed about this, I started 
    to learn HTML and CSS and saw that I made progress in a few months and I liked it very much.
   Now that I was able to build a site, I realized that CSS was exhausted, and of course I 
   searched for more comfortable code writer. I was told that there was something called 
   SASS (Scss) and within 1 day I was SASS (Scss). Then I started the hard part of JavaScript,
    it was hard, it took me months but I did it. Now I try to learn something new every day. </p>
